<h2>Overview</h2>




<p>The Department of Classics at UC Berkeley is a leading center for the study of Greco-Roman antiquity, offering excellent undergraduate and graduate education in the language, literature, history, philosophy, religion, archaeology, and art of two major cultures of the ancient Mediterranean world. It is the intellectual home of a distinguished faculty, excellent graduate students, and an extraordinarily talented and diverse group of undergraduates. Our community is also enriched by many visiting scholars, including the annual Jane K. Sather Professor of Classical Literature.</p>




<p>The mission of the department has four major components:</p>




<ol>
	<li>To give students across the University access to the literature, history, archaeology, mythology, and philosophy of the ancient Greek and Roman world through an array of undergraduate courses on classical culture; in these courses, students access ancient writings not in the original Greek and Latin but through English translations. These courses introduce students to significant texts, artifacts, and ideas of the ancient world, while also putting these into their broader historical context. Such study deepens students' understanding of present-day issues by inculcating a sense of historical perspective that takes account of both the differences and the continuities between contemporary and ancient cultures. The department also provides instruction in Greek and Latin, from the beginning to the advanced levels, to undergraduate and graduate students across a wide range of fields.</li>
	<li>To enable undergraduates to immerse themselves in the language and culture of ancient Greece and Rome through its majors in Greek, Latin, Classical Languages, and Classical Civilizations. These majors equip students with knowledge and analytical skills that can be applied in many areas (e.g., law, politics, business, biosciences, computer science, and media), as well as provide essential preparation for graduate study in Classics, Comparative Literature, Philosophy, and other fields.</li>
	<li>To train and mentor future scholars and teachers through its top-rated graduate programs in Classics and Classical Archaeology. The program in Classics combines intensive linguistic training in both Greek and Latin with wide-ranging intellectual exploration (including literature, history, archaeology, philosophy, and linguistics).  The program in Classical Archaeology comprises the study of the material culture of Ancient Greek, Roman, and related cultures (e.g., Aegean, Etruscan, Punic) in order to understand their nature and development, drawing on evidence provided by ancient texts, settlement data, architectural remains, craft goods, art objects, and environmental materials.</li>
	<li>To seek, through its faculty appointments, the breadth and excellence that can sustain these three goals. The department encourages individual and collaborative faculty research, intellectual engagement with students at all levels, and effective participation in the administrative and advisory work of the department, the College of Letters and Science, the Academic Senate, and the campus and university as a whole.</li>
</ol>




<p>The Department of Classics encourages faculty participation in other programs and cooperation with other departments. It includes several faculty with joint appointments, and it enjoys strong connections with Art History, Comparative Literature, History, Linguistics, Medieval Studies, Near Eastern Studies, Philosophy, Religious Studies, Rhetoric, Theater Dance &amp; Performance Studies, the Graduate Group in Ancient History &amp; Mediterranean Archaeology, and the Graduate Theological Union.  On campus, Classics faculty direct the Nemea Center for Classical Archaeology, the Aleshire Center for the Study of Greek Epigraphy, and the Center for the Tebtunis Papyri and are actively involved with the Berkeley Center for the Study of Religion, the Phoebe Apperson Hearst Museum of Anthropology, and the Archaeological Research Facility.</p>

This course will focus on ideas about magic in the Greek and Roman worlds from about 750 BCE through 400 CE. Topics will include witches, holy men, love spells, necromancy, spirits, and mystery religions. We will examine how magic was represented in high literature (by authors like Homer, Ovid, Apuleius, and Lucian). as well as the more practical evidence of curse tablets and the Greek Magical Papyri. Consideration will be given to analyzing</span><span class="deschide"> the relationship between magic, religion, and philosophy. Our goal will be to study the common threads that connect different Greek and Roman magical practices, as well as to understand them in their cultural contexts.</span><br/>

The ancient Mediterranean world was a world full of gods: from the poems of Homer to the small towns of the Roman empire, we can find people constantly interacting with and thinking about the gods. Myth, ritual, oracles, mystery cults, magic, philosophy: these were all ways that Greeks and Romans engaged with the divine. War, peace, health, sickness, hope, fear: these were some of the reasons for these engagements. This course explores the polytheism</span><span class="deschide"> of ancient Greece and Rome (c.800 BCE to c.200 CE), with close attention to both the ancient literary evidence and the archaeological material from the period. We will seek to understand both the long-term continuities and the important changes in religious life during Mediterranean antiquity.</span><br/>

Classical literature is full of mythological plots involving gods and monsters, heroes and kings. Less prominent are the kind of plots we are used to from modern literature, especially novels: plots that revolve around fictional characters invented to look like people in the street.

Religion and literature are two conceptual systems through which people and societies organize disparate experiences into meaningful wholes. In the ancient pagan societies of Greece and Rome, where a shared experience of both religion and literature was a defining element of the community, these two systems were particularly interdependent. In this course we will read a variety of texts (e.g. epic, philosophy, tragedy) and examine the complex ways that literary</span><span class="deschide"> concepts such as plot, character, closure and genre interact with religious concepts such as causation, moral justice, divine power, cosmology.

This course aims to explore the development of classical Greek rhetoric from the fifth century through the end of the fourth century BCE. In light of Plato’s and Aristotle’s analyses of the subject, we tend to view rhetoric as an art (technê) consisting of a set of methodically organized principles or norms for the production of persuasive speech. The use of rhetorical techniques, however, was widespread in the Greek speaking world well before Plato and Aristotle</span><span class="deschide"> began to reflect on its norms.

Slavery was one of the central institutions of life in classical Greece and Rome and had a profound affect on the ways these societies represented themselves and their world. In this course we will first spend some time learning about the historical condition of slavery in these two societies, then read a variety of works that show some of the ways that slaves and slavery operated in the intellectual and imaginative life of ancient authors. The three genres we will</span><span class="deschide"> focus on are philosophy, drama (both tragedy and comedy) and the novel. There will be a variety of writing assignments of differing lengths and a final exam.</span><br/>

Important individuals in Greek and Roman society were commemorated both in honorific portraits and in biographies written to record for posterity their lives and achievements. In this class we will be reading a selection of Greek and Latin biographical texts (in translation) and comparing them with statuary monuments that represent the same individuals. We will be seeking to elicit the points of contact between the two commemorative traditions, visual and literary</span><span class="deschide">, and to understand the sometimes similar functions they serve. But we will also be attempting to bring out the differences in the way that biographical texts and portrait images operate, and the consequences that this has for the way we, as historians, must approach them.</span><br/>

What time is it? How old is the earth? Where are we located in history? For us these questions may have simple answers: we can look at a watch or a calendar or a timeline. But ancient people thought very differently about these questions. The aim of this class is to see how. We will look at a variety of ancient evidence, including literature (in translation) and archaeology, to discover how Greeks and Romans thought about the deep past (mythic time), how they understood</span><span class="deschide"> the direction and order of history, and how they organized and calculated time in their communities. We will also consider how ancient Jews and Christians came to reject classical conceptions of time and how this rejection still informs modern ideas about time and history.</span><br/>
