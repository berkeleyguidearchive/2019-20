<a name="overview"></a>
<h2>Overview</h2>




<p>Instruction in the Department of Near Eastern Studies (NES) is concerned with the languages, literatures, and civilizations of the ancient, medieval, and modern Near East. The department offers specialized training in archaeology, Assyriology, Egyptology, Judaic and Islamic studies, Comparative Semitics, Turkish language, and Hebrew, Arabic, and Persian language and literature.</p>




<p>The department's courses may also serve to enhance programs in related fields such as anthropology, linguistics, history of art, history, political science, comparative literature, and folklore. Lecture courses offered by the department present a comprehensive body of information on past (Near Eastern) and present (Middle Eastern) civilizations. Many of the courses taught in the department are restricted to a small number of students and thus afford an opportunity for close interaction with the instructing staff.</p>




<p>Cooperative arrangements between the University and the nearby Graduate Theological Union (GTU) enable students in the department to use the extensive library holdings of the GTU and to supplement their programs with additional courses in Syro-Palestinian archaeology, Biblical studies, and Semitic epigraphy and philology.</p>




<a name="libraries"></a>
<h3>Libraries</h3>




<p>The four NES libraries play an essential role in the Department of Near Eastern Studies and are indispensable for student research. The libraries house reference materials and function as reading and seminar rooms for students and faculty.</p>




<p>The Islamic Studies Library contains references and other materials relating to Islamic Studies and Arabic, Persian, and Turkish languages and literatures, and incorporates the Mahjoub Persian Library. The Hebrew/Semitics library includes references and other materials relating to the fields of Comparative Semitics, and Hebrew and Judaic studies. Access <span id="docs-internal-guid-344fa19d-9f9b-a2c1-ceac-e0e5f084bf95">— </span>apart from seminar classes <span id="docs-internal-guid-344fa19d-9f9b-a2c1-ceac-e0e5f084bf95">—</span> is generally limited to graduate students in the department. Both libraries are non circulating. The Cuneiform Seminar Room is a library that provides a wide range of reference works, text editions, and primary sources for the study of the Ancient Near East, including Sumerian, Akkadian, Hittite, Archaeology, and Art History.</p>




<p>The Baer-Keller Library of Egyptology is a non circulating collection of Egyptological volumes maintained by the Near Eastern Studies Department primarily for the use of UC Berkeley students and faculty pursuing serious study of Egyptology. Egyptology students and professionals from other institutions are also welcome; interested individuals should apply to the Near Eastern Studies Department for access. The core of the library collection comes from bequests to NES by Professors Klaus Baer (1987) and Cathleen (Candy) Keller (2008). Professor Baer was an Associate Professor of Egyptology and History at UC Berkeley before becoming a Professor of Egyptology at the Oriental Institute, University of Chicago. Professor Keller was an Associate Professor of Egyptology at UC Berkeley for many years.</p>




<a name="research"></a>
<h3 class="introtext">Research</h3>




<p>The <a href="http://hearstmuseum.berkeley.edu/">Phoebe Hearst Museum of Anthropology</a> has extensive holdings of ancient artifacts, including Classical material, cuneiform tablets, and an ancient Egyptian collection of more than 17,000 objects.</p>




<p>The <a href="http://tebtunis.berkeley.edu/index">Tebtunis Papyri</a> consist of the papyrus documents that were found in the winter of 1899/1900 at the site of ancient Tebtunis, Egypt. The expedition to Tebtunis, led by the British archaeologists Bernard Grenfell and Arthur Hunt, was financed for the University of California by Mrs. Phoebe Apperson Hearst. The Tebtunis Papyri are the largest collection of papyrus documents from a single site in the United States. Although the collection has never been counted and inventoried completely, the number of fragments contained in it exceeds 21,000.</p>




<p>The department's Ancient Near Eastern Seminar Room houses two Open Richly Annotated Cuneiform Corpus <a href="http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/">(ORACC)</a> projects: the Digital Corpus of Cuneiform Lexical Texts <a href="http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/dcclt/">(DCCLT) </a>under the directorship of <a href="http://nes.berkeley.edu/Web_Veldhuis/index.html"> Niek Veldhuis</a> and Hellenistic Babylonian Texts Images and Names <a href="http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/hbtin">(HBTIN)</a> directed by Laurie Pearce. Dr. Pearce also heads another digital database project, the Berkeley Prosopography Service<a href="http://berkeleyprosopography.org/"> (BPS)</a>.</p>

Demotic (derived from the Greek word demos, meaning &quot;people&quot;) is the spoken and written language used by the people of Egypt during the Saite, Persian, Ptolemaic, and Roman periods (664 BCE–452 CE).

This course introduces the hieroglyphic texts of the temples of the Ptolemaic and Roman periods--a time when an increase in the number of signs, and the values that they could hold, widened the scribal playing field for creating expressions that function on multiple aural, visual, and thematic levels. In addition to studying the language, grammar, content, and purpose of the texts, we will examine individual scribal techniques used to foreground words and phrases</span><span class="deschide"> singled out for emphasis, showing how they create interconnections between texts, reliefs, and architecture in the three-dimensional space of the temple.</span><br/>

Ancient Egypt has fascinated visitors since antiquity to our modern imagination. From mummies, pyramids, and enchanting mythologies, these fanciful ideas have made their ways into books, movies, cartoons, and music.

The course focuses on ancient astronomy from Babylonia to the Greco-Roman world. Readings from primary texts, including Babylonian astronomical and astrological documents (MUL.APIN, Enuma Anu Enlil, etc.) and Greek treatises such as Geminos= Introduction to the Phenomena and Ptolemy's Almagest are used. Problems of the calendar and of planetary motion are of special interest. Two different approaches to celestial phenomena are covered, one from</span><span class="deschide"> cuneiform texts, predominantly arithmetical and linear and the other from hellenistic Greek antiquity, characteristically geometrical and introducing a quantitative dimension only after contact with and borrowing from Babylonian astronomy.</span><br/>

The most famous of Babylonian heroes is Gilgamesh, King of Uruk. The Gilgamesh Epic, recorded on twelve tablets in cuneiform, follows him in his quest for fame and eternal life. In this course, we will read the Gilgamesh Epic as well as several earlier texts around the same character. Moreover, we will read additional ancient texts that elucidate one or another aspect of the Epic. We will follow the traditions around Gilgamesh and see how his fame</span><span class="deschide"> was used for literary, religious, and political purposes. Finally, we will look at some of the modern Gilgamesh interpretations.</span><br/>

Today, much of the information we gather on any topic comes from Internet sources. Goal of this class is to increase students' skills in critically evaluating the scholarly value of information on the Ancient Near East that is to be found in web pages, e-journals, and online books.

The dynamics of identity in contemporary Israeli and Palestinian fiction. Since in both literary traditions the quest for identity invariably involves an encounter with the cultural &quot;other,&quot; the examination of this phenomenon within a single context can be revealing. We will approach the subject through lectures, discussion, and the viewing of video and film dramatizations of Arabic and Hebrew works that deal with identity, and make use of the class location</span><span class="deschide"> to significantly enhance learning by visiting Arabic and Hebrew theaters and literary establishments and by meeting and interacting with Israeli and Palestinian writers, critics, and scholars. English is the language of instruction, and the required readings of novels, novellas, short stories, and works of literary and cultural criticism are in English translation. A midterm, final examination, and two short analytical papers are required.</span><br/>

This course examines the social and religious lives of women and men through the lens of the law. A major concern is the relationship between law and culture, namely, the ways in which the law reflected ideals and tensions ranging from ideological competition between states to the problems of ordinary townspeople and peasants. In analyzing actual court cases, we will ask how individuals participated in the life of the court, and how they used the court to articulate</span><span class="deschide"> their own self-interest and sense of moral worth. Readings will be in English. Students wishing to work with sources in the original Ottoman Turkish should also enroll in Turkish 104 (1 unit).</span><br/>
