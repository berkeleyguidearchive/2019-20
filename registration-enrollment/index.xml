<h3><span>Cancellation or Withdrawal of Registration</span></h3>
<p>If you do not wish to attend the University for a semester and instruction has not yet begun, you must submit a withdrawal form via CalCentral &gt; My Dashboard &gt; Student Resources &gt; Add a Withdrawal Request. Tuition and fees will be removed from your account if completed before instruction begins. If instruction has already begun and you find it necessary to stop attending classes, you must submit the Withdrawal form via CalCentral &gt; My Dashboard &gt; Student Resources &gt; Add a Withdrawal Request. Tuition and Fees will be pro-rated depending on the withdrawal date. Health Insurance, Class Pass, and Document Management Fee will remain assessed at 100% if withdrawn after instruction begins.</p>
<p>Whether you cancel or withdraw, any classes in which you are enrolled will be dropped from your schedule, and you will no longer be eligible to attend for that semester or any future semester until you are readmitted.</p>
<p>For further information on Cancellation and Withdrawal, please see the <a href="http://registrar.berkeley.edu/registration/cancellation-withdrawal" target="_blank">Office of the Registrar website</a>.</p>
<hr/>
<h3><span>Tuition and Registration Fee Adjustments</span></h3>
<p>The amount of tuition and registration fees that you may be responsible for at the time of your withdrawal or cancellation is prorated based on the effective date of your withdrawal or cancellation, according to the tables published on the <a href="http://registrar.berkeley.edu/registration/cancellation-withdrawal/refunds-after-withdrawal">Office of the Registrar website</a>.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> The Health Insurance, Class Pass, and Document Management fees are nonrefundable and, therefore, remain assessed at 100 percent for all withdrawals, regardless of the <span id="docs-internal-guid-98e6efd5-394a-9d09-7d41-9349828752e5">date of withdrawal</span>.</p>

<h3 class="hed3">Law Governing Residence</h3>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-4a0faf55-7fff-52fe-a7f3-b5e602252de2">The rules regarding legal residence for tuition and fee purposes at the University of California are governed by the California Education Code as adopted by Standing Order 110.2 and Regents Policy 3105 of The Regents of the University of California. Under these rules, adult citizens, permanent resident card holders, or certain classes of immigrants and non-immigrants can establish residency for tuition and fee purposes. There are also particular rules that apply to the residency classification of minors (under the age of 18 years).</span></p>
<hr/>
<h3 class="hed3">Who Is a California Resident?</h3>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-4049ba68-7fff-8195-fa99-e0236d278ce1">If you are an adult — 24 years and older — or a graduate student and want to be classified as a resident for tuition and fee purposes, you must be in an eligible immigration status for at least 366 days prior to the residence determination date for the term for which you seek a resident classification. The residence determination date is the day instruction begins at UC Berkeley. Eligible immigration statuses include U.S. citizen, permanent resident, and certain non-immigrant visas. However, some non-immigrant visas may preclude you from establishing residency (i.e. B, F, J, TD/TN). You must also have established your continuous physical presence in California for at least 366 days prior to the residence determination date for the semester during which you would like a resident classification, and relinquished ties to any previous residence. Additionally, you must present objective evidence that you intend to make California your permanent home. Physical presence within the state solely for educational purposes does not constitute the establishment of California residency under state law, regardless of the length of your stay. Your residency cannot be derived from your spouse, nor a registered domestic partner. If you are an undergraduate student under the age of 24 and you are financially dependent on a parent who has met the requirements to be considered a California resident for tuition and fee purposes, you may be eligible for a resident classification.</span></p>

<h3 class="hed3">Establishing Intent to Become a California Resident</h3>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-8dac8254-7fff-1785-a76f-f9b4e9fbc54c">Indications of your intent to make California your permanent residence can include obtaining a California driver’s license or, if you did not previously have a driver’s license from any state, a California State Identification Card; obtaining a California vehicle registration if you own and operate a vehicle in the state; registering to vote in California; paying California income taxes as a resident or part-year resident; designating California as your permanent address on all school and employment records, including military records if you are in the military service; establishing a California residence in which you keep your permanent belongings; licensing for professional practice in California; and the absence of these indications in other states during any period for which you claim California residency. Documentary evidence is required. All relevant indications will be considered in determining your classification. Your intent will be questioned if you return to your prior state of residence when the University is not in session.</span></p>
<hr/>
<h3 class="hed3">Financial Independence Requirement</h3>
<p class="appendixbody"><span id="docs-internal-guid-5cf3747a-fe3f-46af-3a22-ab619e88b006">Effective Fall 1993, if your parents do not meet the requirements to be considered California residents for tuition and fee purposes, you will be required to demonstrate financial independence, along with physical presence and intent, when seeking a resident classification for tuition and fee purposes. You must also be in an eligible immigration status. You are considered “financially independent” if one or more of the following applies:</span></p>
<ul>
	<li>You are a graduate or professional student, regardless of age</li>
	<li>You are at least 24 years of age by December 31 of the Academic Year you request a resident classification</li>
	<li>You are a married or registered domestic partner</li>
	<li>You are serving in the U.S. Armed Forces</li>
	<li>You are a veteran of the US Armed Forces</li>
	<li>You are a ward of the court, foster youth, or both of your parents are deceased</li>
	<li>You have a legal dependent other than a spouse or registered domestic partner</li>
	<li>You have been declared by a court to be an Emancipated Minor</li>
	<li>You have been determined to be an unaccompanied youth who was homeless pursuant to federal financial aid rules</li>
	<li>You are a single undergraduate student who was not claimed as an income tax deduction by your parents or any other individual for the tax year immediately preceding the term for which you are requesting a resident classification, and you can demonstrate complete self-sufficiency for one year immediately preceding the residence determination date. This means you must have supported yourself with your own resources (employment, commercial/institutional loans in your name only, financial aid, and savings from earnings, all of which require documentation), and should be able to cover your basic expenses (tuition, rent, food, and vehicle) for one full year prior to the term for which you are requesting a resident classification</li>
	<li>You are a student who turned 18 years of age in California while your parents were residents for tuition purposes of the state AND your California resident parents left the state to establish residence elsewhere AND you, the student, continued to reside in California after your parents' departure</li>

Qualifying temporary absences are defined as of limited duration, evidenced by a start and end date, and are purpose-based to include a temporary employment assignment, medical treatment, and qualifying educational programs, all of which require objective documentation.  You and your parents have the burden of providing clear and convincing evidence of maintaining their continuing California residence during all absences from the state.
