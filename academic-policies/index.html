				<a name="semestersystemunitsrepetitionofcoursestext"></a><h2>Semester System, Units, &amp; Repetition of Courses</h2><div>
<h3>The Semester System</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>Under the semester system on the UC Berkeley campus, the academic year is divided into two semesters and one summer session. Quarter units, either earned previously at Berkeley or at another institution, are converted to semester units by multiplying by two-thirds (for example, 180 quarter units equal 120 semester units).</p>
<hr/>
<h3>Courses and Units</h3>
<p>Most University courses are assigned a unit value. One unit represents three hours of work per week by the student, including class attendance, preparation, and outside work.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>Repetition of Courses</h3>
<p>You may repeat only courses in which you received a grade of D+, D, D-, F, NP, or U. You may repeat an I grade subject to certain limitations (see Grade I). Courses in which you received a grade of D+, D, D-, or F, and courses that you undertook for a letter grade but for which you received a grade of I, may not be repeated on a passed/not passed or satisfactory/unsatisfactory basis. Repetition of a course more than once requires approval by the dean of the college, school, or division in which you are enrolled at the time you repeat the course. Without this approval, a course repeated more than once will not be included in the grade point average (GPA), but a passing grade in the repeated course will be accepted in satisfaction of unit requirements for the degree. Degree credit for a repeated course will be given only once, but the grade assigned at each enrollment is permanently recorded. If you repeat courses in which you received a grade of D+, D, D-, or F, the units are counted only once and only the most recently earned grades and grade points are used for the first 12 units repeated. Second repetitions that are approved by the dean of a student's college or school are to be included in the 12-unit limitation. In case of repetitions beyond the 12 units, the GPA is based on all grades assigned and total units attempted. If, however, you receive a grade of I upon repetition of a course, the grade of D+, D, D-, or F will continue to be computed in the GPA until the I grade is replaced. If you repeat an I in a letter-grade course, the I will lapse to an F unless you have permission of the dean of your college or school to retain the I grade for a longer period.</p>
</div>
			</div>
			<div id="gradestextcontainer" class="tab_content" role="tabpanel">
				<a name="gradestext"></a><h2>Grades</h2><p><span>The work of all students on the UC Berkeley campus is reported in terms of the following grades: A (excellent); B (good); C (fair); D (barely passed); F (failure); P (passed at a minimum level of C- for undergraduate students); NP (not passed); S (satisfactory, passed at a minimum level of B- for graduate students); U (unsatisfactory); I (work incomplete due to circumstances beyond the student’s control, but of passing quality); and IP (work in progress, final grade to be assigned upon completion of entire course sequence). The grades A, B, C, and D may be modified by plus (+) or minus (-) suffixes.</span></p>
<p>A course in which the grade A, B, C, D, or P (undergraduate students only) is counted toward degree requirements. A course receiving the grade S (graduate students only) is similarly counted subject to Academic Senate regulations. A course in which the grade F, NP, or U is received is not counted toward degree requirements. A course in which the grade of I or IP is received is not counted toward degree requirements until the I or IP is replaced by grade A, B, C, D, P, or S.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>Grade Points</h3>
<p>Grade points per unit are assigned as follows: A=4, B=3, C=2, D=1, and F=none. When attached to the grades A, B, C, or D, plus (+) grades carry three-tenths of a grade point more per unit, and minus (-) grades three-tenths of a grade point less per unit than unsuffixed grades, except for A+, which carries 4.0 grade points per unit as does the A.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>Grade Point Average (GPA)</h3>
<p>Your GPA is computed on courses undertaken in the University of California. Effective fall 2005, XB courses undertaken in UC Berkeley Extension count toward your GPA. Grades A, B, C, D, and F are used in determining your GPA; grades IP, P, S, NP, and U carry no grade points and are excluded from all grade-point computations. Grade I, if assigned before fall 1973, is included and is computed as an F; an I grade assigned fall 1973 and later is excluded from computations. For additional information, see the <a href="/2019-20/academic-policies/#semestersystemunitsrepetitionofcoursestext">Repetition of Courses</a> section<a href="/2019-20/academic-policies/" target="_blank">.</a></p>
<hr/>
<h3>Special Provisions: Graduate Students</h3>
<p>Only courses graded A, B, C (with or without plus or minus signs), or S are accepted in satisfaction of degree requirements. Courses graded below C- do not yield unit credit toward a higher degree, regardless of your overall GPA. Graduate students must maintain a minimum GPA of 3.0 in all upper division and graduate coursework undertaken in graduate standing in the University of California or its exchange programs.</p>
<p><em>Note: </em>Departments, schools, and groups may have a higher performance standard than the minimum B average (3.0 GPA) required by the Graduate Division. You must also work full time at your academic or professional program unless a program with fewer units is approved under special circumstances by your graduate adviser. In addition, you must successfully complete all coursework required by your department, school, or group program, be advanced to candidacy, pass the required examinations, and fulfill other requirements specified for the program.</p>
<p>For a course extending over more than one semester in which evaluation of your performance is deferred until the end of the final semester, provisional grades of In Progress (IP) may be assigned in the intervening semesters. The provisional grades are replaced by the final grade if you complete the full sequence. If you do not complete the full sequence, then you will be given an I grade if the instructor has no other basis for assigning a grade. Further changes will be made according to Academic Senate regulations.</p>
<p>With the consent of the department involved, graduate students may enroll in courses in the 600-series. These courses are evaluated by means of the grades satisfactory and unsatisfactory (S and U). They prepare you for appropriate master’s or doctoral examinations and do not count toward academic residence or the unit requirements for a higher degree. You may earn 1-8 units of 601 or 602 per semester or 1-4 units per summer session toward examination preparation. Units earned in these courses may not be used to meet academic residence or unit requirements for the Master or Doctor's degree. No credit is allowed for work graded unsatisfactory.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>Passed/Not Passed and Satisfactory/ Unsatisfactory Grades</h3>
<p>If you are an undergraduate in good academic standing (2.0 GPA or better, or in good academic standing under the academic probation regulations of your college or school), you may elect to take letter-graded courses on a passed/not passed basis, and if you are a graduate student in good academic standing, you may elect to take letter-graded courses on a satisfactory/unsatisfactory basis with the consent of your department, school, or group. Credit for courses taken on these bases is limited to one-third of the total units that you have taken and passed on the Berkeley campus at the time your degree is awarded. Included in this one-third are any units completed in an Education Abroad program, or on another University of California campus in an intercampus exchange program, or in a joint doctoral program. For graduate degree programs, grades of satisfactory assigned in courses numbered 299 and of the 300, 400, or 600 series are excluded from this computation. If you enroll in a course offered only on a passed/not passed or satisfactory/unsatisfactory basis, you will be graded P/NP if an undergraduate and S/U if a graduate.</p>
<p>A course that is required in or prerequisite to your major may be taken on a P/NP or S/U basis only upon approval of the faculty of your school or college.</p>
<p>If you are a special or limited-status student, you may take courses on a P/NP basis at the discretion of the dean of your college or school. You may not repeat a course on a P/NP basis that you have previously taken on a letter-graded basis.</p>
<p>The option of being graded P/NP or S/U in a course may be cancelled if you are found to be ineligible for the option.</p>
<p>If you want honors at graduation, you should consult your college, school, or division for additional restrictions.</p>
<p>Your level of performance must correspond to a minimum letter grade of C- if you are to receive a passed grade, and to a B- if you are to receive a satisfactory grade.</p>
<p>These rules may be further limited by the faculties of the various schools and colleges and by the Graduate Council.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>Grade I (Incomplete)</h3>
<p>The grade I may be assigned if your work in a course has been of passing quality, but is incomplete for reasons beyond your control. Prior arrangements must be made with the instructor because in assigning the I grade the instructor is required to specify the reasons to the department chair.</p>
<p>For graduate students, the I grade will remain on the record until the required work is completed. Graduate students should finish the course requirements as soon as possible. To remove an I grade from your record, you must file the appropriate petition with the Office of the Registrar. The method of replacement of the I grade by a final grade will be determined by the Dean of the Graduate Division and the Graduate Council. </p>
<p>Although I grades are not counted in computing the GPA, it is important to remove them quickly. You should seek the advice of the Graduate Division if you have further questions concerning I grades.</p>
<p>For undergraduate students, an I grade received in the fall semester must be replaced by the first day of instruction in the following fall semester.</p>
<p>An I grade received in the spring semester or summer session must be replaced by the first day of instruction in the following spring semester.</p>
<p>When you complete the required work or deferred examination, grade points will be assigned if you receive a grade of A, B, C, or D. If you repeat the course, grade points will then be assigned to the earned grade only if the dean has given prior written approval to repeat it. If you repeat the course without the approval of the dean, the I grade will be converted to an F and the repeated course will be treated the same as any other course in which you receive an F. The dean of your college or school may extend the deadline for undergraduate completion of an I grade. For undergraduates, except as noted below, any I grade which has not been replaced within the above deadlines will, at the end of that time, be converted to grade F (or NP if taken passed/not passed). After that time, but not retroactively, the grade is counted in computing your GPA.</p>
<p><strong>Exceptions:</strong> Within the above deadlines for completing an I grade, undergraduate students may notify the dean that they have not attempted completion and will not complete the work required for removal of the I grade, and may request that the grade not be replaced by an F (or NP). This procedure is limited to a maximum of two courses. Once the decision has been made, it is irrevocable; the course cannot afterward be completed by any means, including repetition of that course or any equivalent course.</p>
<p>If a degree is conferred before the end of the above deadlines following the assignment of an I grade, the grade will not be converted to an F (or NP). However, you still have the option of removing the I grade within the above deadlines.</p>
<p>If you are an undergraduate student with 12 or more units of I on your record, you may not register without the permission of the dean.</p>
<p>Summer 2016 and Prior: Students who receive an I grade must file a &quot;Petition for Grade and Grade Points in an Incomplete Course&quot; <span id="docs-internal-guid-038bb1ab-7fff-c885-144f-27c314f918e1">with the instructor by the appropriate deadline. You may</span> pick up the petition at Cal Student Central, 120 Sproul Hall. You should make arrangements to complete the course 30 days before the deadline. File the petition with the instructor when you have completed the course.</p>
<p>Fall 2016 and later: You should make arrangements to complete the course 30 days before the deadline. The instructor will file a change of grade <span id="docs-internal-guid-18b7afe2-7fff-2e7b-bb56-b7054806d730">for Incompletes through CalCentral and</span> Campus Solutions.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>Grade IP (In Progress)</h3>
<p>If you take a course extending over more than one term and evaluation of your performance is deferred until the end of the final term, provisional grades of IP (In Progress) are assigned in the intervening term(s). The provisional grades are replaced by one final grade if you complete the full sequence. The IP grade is not included in the GPA. Effective with an IP assigned fall 1973 or later, if the full sequence is not completed as scheduled, the IP will be replaced by a grade of Incomplete. Further changes in your record will be subject to the rules pertaining to I grades above.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>Changes of Grade</h3>
<p>All grades except I and IP above are considered final when assigned by an instructor at the end of a term. An instructor may request a change of grade when a computational, clerical, or procedural error occurred in the original assignment of a grade, but a grade may not be changed as a result of reevaluation of your work. No final grade may be revised as a result of reexamination or the submission of additional work after the close of the term.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>Grade Appeal Process</h3>
<p>If you have a grievance about a grade, you should first try to speak with your instructor and/or the student <a href="http://sa.berkeley.edu/ombuds" target="_blank">ombuds</a>. If that does not resolve your grievance, you may formally appeal. The following are grounds for appeal: the application of non-academic criteria, such as the consideration of race, politics, religion, sex, or other criteria not directly reflective of performance related to course requirements; sexual harassment; or improper academic procedures that unfairly affect your grade. Formal procedures may not be activated unless you (the student) and the instructor in charge have failed to resolve the dispute informally. <span id="docs-internal-guid-048ca7e6-7fff-5419-5885-71acca1d267e">You (the student) may opt to include an ombuds (or any mutually accepted third party) and/or the department chair in assisting in informally resolving the dispute informally.</span> The formal process must be initiated within one calendar year from the last day of the semester in which the final grade for the course was posted. The formal process, once initiated, is to be completed at the unit level within 20-working days and at the Senate level within 40-working days if both parties are in residence and the University is in regular session (excluding summer session).</p>
<hr/>
<h3>Formal Appeal of Grades in Courses and Examinations</h3>
<p>Each department or other instructional unit shall establish a standing grievance committee chair who is not the chair of the department. For each case, the grievance committee chair will appoint an ad hoc grievance committee composed of three faculty members—only two of whom can be from the same unit—<span id="docs-internal-guid-d2df7a63-bcf9-7af0-0823-829c96ae66a9">and two students in good standing appointed by the student association of the unit</span>. If no student association exists, the students are to be appointed by the ASUC or the Graduate Assembly. (The student members must have passed courses or an examination in the unit at least at the level of the disputed course or examination and have been in residence for at least one year.) The ad hoc grievance committee will review all the required materials (from the student and instructor) and make a recommendation regarding a resolution to the grievance. The ad hoc grievance committee’s recommendation to the Committee on Courses of Instruction (COCI), including any minority views, must be given in writing.</p>
<p>If COCI finds in the student’s favor, it may change a failing grade to a P or S, drop a course retroactively, retain the course but eliminate the grade from the GPA, or adopt the letter grade, if any, that was recommended by four of the five members of the grievance committee of the unit(s).</p>
<p>For a complete copy of current grade grievance procedures, please see the <a href="http://academic-senate.berkeley.edu/committees/coci" target="_blank">COCI page on the Academic Senate's website</a>. Here is a complete copy of <a href="https://academic-senate.berkeley.edu/regulations/a207-grade-appeals" target="_blank">Berkeley Division Regulation A207</a>, which governs grade appeals.</p>

			<div id="creditbyexaminationtextcontainer" class="tab_content" role="tabpanel">
				<a name="creditbyexaminationtext"></a><h2>Credit by Examination</h2><h3><span>Undergraduate Students</span></h3>
<p>You may earn credit by examination in two ways:</p>
<ol>
	<li>If you are a new or re-entering undergraduate student, on the recommendation of the Board of Admissions you may be allowed credit by examination for knowledge that you acquired since graduation from high school, either by independent study or at another institution, and for which you have not been allowed advanced standing credit. You should apply to the <a href="http://registrar.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/pdf/CREDIT.EXAM.Pet.pdf" target="_blank">Office of the Registrar</a> for credit.</li>
	<li>If you are a student in good standing and currently registered in a regular session, you may qualify for course credit by examination. You may apply for credit to the dean of your college or school on the “Petition for Credit by Examination,” obtainable from the <a href="http://registrar.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/pdf/CREDIT.EXAM.Pet.pdf" target="_blank">Office of the Registrar</a>. You may apply for credit by examination in any course listed in the current bulletin that pertains to the regular sessions at UC Berkeley. However, the subject in which you want to be examined should be one in which, in the opinion of the instructor in charge or the department, knowledge can be tested by examination. You must file a separate petition for each course. In certain laboratory, field, or practice courses, neither a written nor an oral examination may be a satisfactory test.</li>
</ol>
<p>You may <u>not</u> receive credit by examination:</p>
<ol>
	<li>If the credit would duplicate credit that you presented for admission to the University.</li>
	<li>In elementary courses in your native language if it is not English.</li>
</ol>
<p>The examination must cover the entire course and be administered at one sitting of no longer than three hours. It may be the regularly scheduled final examination for the class, provided that the examination meets the foregoing criteria. The result of the examination may be reported to the Office of the Registrar only as passed or satisfactory, according to the regulations governing the assignment of these grades. Further information concerning credit by examination may be obtained from the <a href="http://registrar.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/pdf/CREDIT.EXAM.Pet.pdf" target="_blank">Office of the Registrar</a>.</p>
<h3>Graduate Students</h3>
<p>If you are a graduate student in residence, you may petition to receive a limited amount of course credit toward your degree by passing examinations on material covered in certain courses in lieu of taking those courses. Laboratory courses, graduate seminar, and research courses are excluded. You must be registered for at least 4 units of upper division and/or graduate coursework at the time you take the examination and you must be in good academic standing (3.0 GPA or better). The final result of the examination will only be reported as satisfactory or unsatisfactory. You may obtain the petition from the <a href="http://registrar.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/pdf/CREDIT.EXAM.Pet.pdf" target="_blank">Office of the Registrar</a>.

				<a name="midtermfinalexaminationstext"></a><h2>Midterm &amp; Final Examinations</h2><p><span>The number of midterm examinations varies at the discretion of the instructor. Deficient grades for undergraduate students whose work at midterm is of D+, D, D-, F, or NP quality are posted on CalCentral during the ninth week of the semester. </span></p>
<p>Final examinations are required in all undergraduate non-laboratory courses, with the exception of courses that the <a href="http://registrar.berkeley.edu/sis-SC-message" target="_blank">online Schedule of Classes</a> indicates do not require a final examination. This requirement allows you to demonstrate mastery of course material while providing the instructor with written evidence for evaluation. The examination may last no longer than three hours and must be administered at the time announced in the <a href="http://registrar.berkeley.edu/sis-SC-message" target="_blank">online Schedule of Classes</a>. Any deviation from this announced time requires approval from the Committee on Courses of Instruction or, as appropriate, the department chair. This requirement guarantees you ample prior notice of the examination time and eliminates conflict with other examinations.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of instructors and/or departments to return to students their final examinations or copies of them, or to retain students’ final examin­ations or copies of them, for 13 months after the dates of such examinations.</p>

				<a name="degreeprogresstext"></a><h2>Degree Progress</h2><h3>Undergraduate Students</h3>
<h4>Progress Toward a Degree</h4>
<p>At the close of each semester, the courses, units, grades, and grade points earned are added onto your cumulative University record. From this record, you may determine your progress toward a degree.</p>
<p>In working for a degree, you should keep in mind the various levels on which you must satisfy requirements-- University, campus, college or school, and department-- as well as the kinds of requirements you must fulfill: course, unit, grade point, and amount of upper division work. You may receive additional counsel in these matters from your adviser.</p>
<h4>Academic Probation</h4>
<p>Regulations and procedures governing academic probation vary with each college and school. For specific details, consult your college or school announcement. Students on probation may not take courses on a passed/not passed basis.</p>
<h4>Academic Dismissal</h4>
<p>Regulations and procedures governing academic dismissal vary with each college and school. For specific details, consult your college or school.</p>
<p>If you are dismissed, you may appeal for a hearing by formal petition to the dean of your college or school, but the action of dismissal is normally considered final. If you are dismissed and want to transfer to another college or school at Berkeley, you may petition the dean of that college or school.</p>
<h4>Minimum Progress</h4>
<p>For undergraduates, normal progress toward a degree requires 30 units of successfully completed coursework each year. If you fail to achieve minimum academic progress, you may continue to be enrolled only with the approval of the dean of your college or school. To achieve minimum academic progress, you must have successfully completed a number of units no fewer than 15 times the number of semesters, less one, in which you have been enrolled on the Berkeley campus. Summer session is not counted as a semester. A course load of 15 units per semester is considered normal. Minimum course load requirements, however, vary by college or school; see the specific college or school announcement for details. If you enroll in a course load of fewer units than the minimum, you will need to have your schedule approved by the dean of your college or school.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>Graduate Students</h3>
<h4>Probation and Dismissal</h4>
<p>Graduate students are subject to probation and dismissal for academic deficiencies by the Graduate Division under the policies established by the Graduate Council of the Academic Senate. Probation may be initiated by the Graduate Division or by recommendation of the head graduate adviser of your major. The most common reasons for probation are a low GPA and failure to make adequate and timely progress toward the degree. If your probationary status is not rectified within the specified time allowed, you may be subject to dismissal.  If a student has advanced to doctoral candidacy and fails to make adequate progress toward completing the dissertation, probation takes the form of “lapsing” the student’s candidacy. This probationary status must also be resolved and the student’s candidacy reinstated to avoid dismissal.</p>
<p>There are circumstances which allow you to appeal dismissal from graduate standing. The “Graduate Appeal Procedure” is available on the <a href="http://www.grad.berkeley.edu/policies/pdf/gradappeal.pdf" target="_blank">Graduate Division website</a>. The procedure may not be used for complaints regarding actions based solely on faculty evaluation of the academic quality of a student’s performance, or decanal evaluations of a student’s appropriate academic progress, unless the complaint alleges that those actions were unduly biased by non-academic criteria.</p>

				<a name="studentconductappealstext"></a><h2>Student Conduct</h2><h3><span>Student Conduct</span></h3>
<p>When you enroll in the University, you assume an obligation to conduct yourself in a manner compatible with the University’s function as an educational institution. Rules concerning student conduct, student organizations, use of University facilities, and related matters are set forth in The <a href="https://sa.berkeley.edu/code-of-conduct" target="_blank">Code of Student Conduct</a> available online at the <a href="http://sa.berkeley.edu/conduct" target="_blank">Center for Student Conduct's website</a>. </p>
<hr/>
<h3>Academic Misconduct, Cheating, or Plagiarism</h3>
<p>Achievement and proficiency in subject matter includes your realization that neither is to be achieved by academic misconduct. An instructor has the right to give you an F on a single assignment produced by engaging in academic misconduct without determining whether you have a passing knowledge of the relevant factual material. That is an appropriate academic evaluation for a failure to understand or abide by the basic rules of academic study and inquiry. An instructor has the right to assign a final grade of F for the course if you plagiarized a paper for a portion of the course, even if you have successfully and, presumably, honestly passed the remaining portion of the course. It must be understood that any student who knowingly aids in plagiarism or other cheating, e.g., allowing another student to copy a paper or examination question, is as responsible as the cheating student.</p>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-b9164bd2-7fff-cc29-3b71-1a05081d1ea0">If a student is found responsible for academic misconduct there will be a sanction applied. Sanctions range from a non-reportable warning through dismissal and may also include educational sanctions such as reflective writing assignment, activities, and workshops.</span></p>
<hr/>
<h3>Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment Policy</h3>
<p><span class="m_3876656628562191938gmail-im">The Berkeley campus actively monitors and supports full compliance with the official University of California Policy on Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment, which states: &quot;The University of California is committed to creating and maintaining a community dedicated to the advancement, application and transmission of knowledge and creative endeavors through academic excellence, where all individuals who participate in University programs and activities can work and learn together in an atmosphere free of harassment, exploitation, or intimidation. Every member of the community should be aware that the University prohibits sexual violence and sexual harassment, retaliation, and other prohibited behavior (“Prohibited Conduct”) that violates law and/or University policy. The University will respond promptly and effectively to reports of Prohibited Conduct and will take appropriate action to prevent, to correct, and when necessary, to discipline behavior that violates this Policy on Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment (hereafter referred to as Policy).&quot;</span></p>
<p>The campus has complaint procedures designed to facilitate the prompt and equitable resolution of sexual violence and sexual harassment and other discrimination complaints. If you believe that you have been a target of sexual violence and/or sexual harassment, have questions about the policy or about the complaint resolution procedures, you may address your inquiries to the <a href="https://ophd.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Office for the Prevention of Harassment and Discrimination</a>, <a href="mailto:ask_ophd@berkeley.edu" target="_blank">ask_ophd@berkeley.edu</a> or 510-643-7985.

<h3>Student Grievance Procedure</h3>
<p>The Berkeley campus Student Grievance Procedure gives you an opportunity to resolve complaints alleging discrimination, including harassment, on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, disability, age, medical condition (e.g., cancer-related), ancestry, marital status, citizenship, sexual orientation, or status as a veteran or special disabled veteran. The procedure is also available for the resolution of complaints alleging inappropriate application to a student of any other rules or policies of the Berkeley campus resulting in injury to the student. The procedure is not applicable to certain kinds of complaints for which other appropriate appeals procedures exist. For example, the procedure does not apply to a grade appeal based on the application of non-academic criteria. (See Formal Appeal of Grades in Courses and Examinations on the <a href="/2019-20/academic-policies/#gradestext" target="_blank">Grades page</a> of the Academic Policies section of the Berkeley Academic Guide for a description of the grade appeal process.) </p>
<p>It is the intent of this procedure that student complaints should be resolved, if at all possible, in the department or unit where they arise. The procedure contains important time limitations and provisions about the interrelationship between this procedure and other campus complaint procedures. <a href="http://students.berkeley.edu/uga/grievance.stm">Copies of the procedure are available online</a> or in 102 Sproul Hall.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>Graduate Student Appeals</h3>
<p>Through the Graduate Appeal Procedure, graduate students have the right to appeal academic or administrative decisions that have materially hindered their degree progress or resulted in dismissal from their graduate program.</p>
<p>Students must first initiate an appeal with the academic unit (the department, school, or graduate group) responsible for the alleged action under dispute. The Graduate Council requires each instructional unit to maintain copies of its current internal appeal procedure for information and use by its graduate students.</p>
<p>The academic unit and the student must make all reasonable efforts at resolving the difficulty, as outlined in the Graduate Appeal Procedure, before the student may take the matter to the next level, which is the Graduate Division. Students may also consult with the <a href="http://sa.berkeley.edu/ombuds" target="_blank">Ombuds for Students</a> at 510-642-5754 for assistance with informal resolution.</p>
<p>If attempts to resolve the matter with the student's home unit were unsuccessful, the student may submit a formal appeal to the Graduate Division, after carefully following the guidelines and deadlines in the <a href="http://www.grad.berkeley.edu/policies/pdf/gradappeal.pdf" target="_blank">Graduate Appeal Procedure</a>. The <a href="http://grad.berkeley.edu/policies/pdf/appealform.pdf" target="_blank">Graduate Appeal Procedure Form</a> must accompany the appeal.</p>

Note-taking is a means of recording information and helps students absorb and integrate what they learn. Note-taking or other recording of an instructor’s presentation can also facilitate further discussion of the material with students and the instructor. However, class notes and recordings are based on the intellectual effort of the instructor, who has an interest in protecting this effort and ensuring the accuracy of any public representation of his or her work. Prior approval of the instructor is required for the recording of course notes and the sharing of course notes and other class materials beyond the students enrolled in the course. Only a course note-taking service authorized by the campus may make course notes available commercially. </span><span>Here are the</span><a href="http://dsp.berkeley.edu/students/returning-students/services/note-taking/dsp-process-class-notes"> relevant policies</a> for note-taking services.</p>
