<div class="course-section"><p class="course-heading"><strong>Objectives &amp; Outcomes</strong></p><p><strong>Course Objectives:</strong> C6 also includes quantitative reasoning concepts that aren’t covered in Data 8. These include certain topics in: principles of data visualization; simulation of random processes; and understanding numerical functions through their graphs. This will help prepare students for computational and quantitative courses other than Data 8.<br/>C6 takes advantage of the complementarity of computing and quantitative reasoning to enliven abstract ideas and build students’ confidence in their ability to solve real problems with quantitative tools. Students learn computer science concepts and immediately apply them to plot functions, visualize data, and simulate random events.<br/>
<br/>Foundations of Data Science (CS/Info/Stat C8, a.k.a. Data 8) is an increasingly popular class for entering students at Berkeley. Data 8 builds students’ computing skills in the first month of the semester, and students rely on these skills as the course progresses. For some students, particularly those with little prior exposure to computing, developing these skills benefits from further time and practice. C6 is a rapid introduction to Python programming, visualization, and data analysis, which will prepare students for success in Data 8.</p><p><strong>Student Learning Outcomes:</strong> Students will be able to perform basic computations in Python, including working with tabular data.<br/>
Students will be able to understand basic probabilistic simulations.<br/>
Students will be able to understand the syntactic structure of Python code.<br/>
Students will be able to use good practices in Python programming.<br/>
Students will be able to use visualizations to understand univariate data and to identify associations or causal relationships in bivariate data.</p></div>

Foundations of data science from three perspectives: inferential thinking, computational thinking, and real-world relevance. Given data arising from some real-world phenomenon, how does one analyze that data so as to understand that phenomenon? The course teaches critical concepts and skills in computer programming and statistical inference, in conjunction with hands-on analysis of real-world datasets</span><span class="deschide">, including economic data, document collections, geographical data, and social networks. It delves into social and legal issues surrounding data analysis, including issues of privacy and data ownership.</span><br/>

Data Mining and Analytics introduces students to practical fundamentals of data mining and emerging paradigms of data mining and machine learning with enough theory to aid intuition building. The course is project-oriented, with a project beginning in class every week. The in-class portion of the project is meant to be collaborative and a time for the instructor and GSIs to work closely with project groups to understand the objectives, help work through software</span><span class="deschide"> logistics, and connect project work to lecture. Lectures will introduce theories, concepts, practical contexts, and algorithms.

The senior honors thesis seminar gives students an opportunity to experience firsthand what it means to do data science research. Over two semesters, students will learn to formulate a research problem, design a research strategy, collect evidence, and write up the findings and analysis. The first semester focuses primarily on the preparation and implementation of a research proposal, as well as data management strategies. During the second semester, we will emphasize</span><span class="deschide"> analysis and writing. The final result will be a hybrid product with a 20-25 page research paper, with data visualizations and analysis tables, along with a documented data source, annotated code, well documented Github repository, and open science posting of the project.</span><br/>

The senior honors thesis seminar gives students an opportunity to experience firsthand what it means to do data science research. Over two semesters, students will learn to formulate a research problem, design a research strategy, collect evidence, and write up the findings and analysis. The first semester focuses primarily on the preparation and implementation of a research proposal, as well as data management strategies. During the second semester, we will emphasize</span><span class="deschide"> analysis and writing. The final result will be a hybrid product with a 20-25 page research paper, with data visualizations and analysis tables, along with a documented data source, annotated code, well documented Github repository, and open science posting of the project.</span><br/>
