Introduction to basic concepts in radiation detection and radioactivity, electrical circuits, and data analytics. Lectures provide the theoretical foundation of the work being performed in the accompanying laboratory. The course will contain three sections: introduction to how radiation interacts with matter and radiation detection technologies; development of the tools (mathematical and computational) needed for analyzing various types of radiation</span><span class="deschide"> and environmental data; and building of a basic radiation sensor system.</span><br />

<div class="course-section"><p class="course-heading"><strong>Objectives &amp; Outcomes</strong></p><p><strong>Course Objectives:</strong> The course is suitable for Nuclear Engineering students, other Engineering majors, and any students interested in gaining a general understanding of radiation detection.<br /> The focus of this course will be on the application of the nuclear science, radiation detection, and data analysis concepts covered to the building of a multi-sensor radiation detection system, following a template for the required data acquisition software and circuit integration. <br />Fieldwork related to a chosen research topic will be carried out in small groups, with group oral presentations and final reports. Students will be introduced to research opportunities on campus and at nearby lab facilities through tours of lab spaces throughout the department and field trips to LBNL and LLNL.<br/>
<br />Students will be introduced to core concepts in nuclear science, statistical analysis, and computation, while being given practical experience applying those concepts to radiation detection and data analysis.<br />The objective of this course is to provide Freshman and Sophomore students with an introduction to the fundamentals of nuclear radiation and radiation detection through a hands-on approach.<br/></p><p><strong>Student Learning Outcomes:</strong> Be able to outline and carry out a research project, prepare written and oral presentations of that work, and demonstrate how the sensors they built work.<br/>
By the end of this course, students should be able to:<br/>
Identify types of radioactivity, radiation detection methods and sources of environmental radiation,<br/>
<br/>
Create simple circuit designs making use of standard circuitry components, demonstrate basic soldering skills, and demonstrate a familiarity with printed circuit board design tools,<br/>
Make use of software tools including the Python programming language, version control with git, and shell environments,<br/>

This course offers an integrated treatment of three topics essential to modern engineering: linear algebra, random processes, and optimization. These topics will be covered more rapidly than in separate undergraduate courses covering the same material, and will draw on engineering examples for motivation. The stress will be on proofs and computational aspects will also be highlighted.

This course is designed to give students a broad overview of the main topics encompassed by management of technology. It includes the full chain of innovative activities beginning with research and development and extending through production and marketing. Why do many existing firms fail to incorporate new technology in a timely manner? At each stage of innovation, we examine key factors determining successful management of technology. What</span><span class="deschide"> constitutes a successful technology strategy? The integrating course focus will be on the emergence of the knowledge economy and technology as a key knowledge asset and will involve both general readings and cases. The course also introduces students to Haas and COE faculty working in the relevant areas.</span><br />

This course is designed to examine the strategic issues that confront the management of the development stage biotech company, i.e., after its start-up via an initial capital infusion, but before it might be deemed successful (e.g., by virtue of a product launch), or otherwise has achieved &quot;first-tier&quot; status. Thus, the intention is to study the biotech organization during the process of it growth and maturation from an early stage existence</span><span class="deschide"> through &quot;adolescence&quot; into an &quot;adult&quot; company. The focus of the class will be on business development, i.e., the deal making that must occur to accomplish the corporate objectives of bringing in new technologies and getting the initial products to market. We will explore the critical deal issues from both the perspective of the development stage company and the viewpoint of the larger, more mature biotech or big pharma company with which it seeks to partner.</span><br />

This course seeks to make sense of, inter alia, the decline and prospective recovery of U.S. high-technology industries, the evolution of innovation and technology strategies and policies in Western Europe and Asia, the historic and current roles of governments in shaping markets for high-technology goods, and the impact on business strategies of recent developments in early-stage capital markets. Our general approach views technological innovation and competition</span><span class="deschide"> as dynamic processes that reflect previous choices made by firms and governments. Modern technologies develop in markets that are international scope, often imperfectly competitive, and subject to influence by a variety of economic and political stakeholders. We will use an eclectic mix of theoretical, historical, and practical perspectives throughout the course in examining these issues, although no special familarity with any of these is assumed. From time to time, we will be joined by venture capitalists, corporate executives, and technologists engaged in global high-technology markets for discussion of these issues.</span><br />

The fundamental concepts come from the field</span><span class="deschide"> of operations management, but projects present special types of operations because of their intended focus, limited lives, constraints, and uncertainties.
