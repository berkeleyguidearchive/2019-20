Students will be introduced to research opportunities on campus and at nearby lab facilities through tours of lab spaces throughout the department and field trips to LBNL and LLNL.<br/>
<br />Students will be introduced to core concepts in nuclear science, statistical analysis, and computation, while being given practical experience applying those concepts to radiation detection and data analysis.<br />The objective of this course is to provide Freshman and Sophomore students with an introduction to the fundamentals of nuclear radiation and radiation detection through a hands-on approach.<br/></p><p><strong>Student Learning Outcomes:</strong> Be able to outline and carry out a research project, prepare written and oral presentations of that work, and demonstrate how the sensors they built work.<br/>
By the end of this course, students should be able to:<br/>
Identify types of radioactivity, radiation detection methods and sources of environmental radiation,<br/>
<br/>
Create simple circuit designs making use of standard circuitry components, demonstrate basic soldering skills, and demonstrate a familiarity with printed circuit board design tools,<br/>
Make use of software tools including the Python programming language, version control with git, and shell environments,<br/>

This course engages students at the intersection of environmental justice, social justice, and engineering to explore how problems that are commonly defined in technical terms are at their roots deeply socially embedded. Through partnerships with community-based organizations, students are trained to recognize the socio-political nature of technical problems so that they may approach solutions in ways that prioritize social justice. Topics</span><span class="deschide"> covered include environmental engineering as it relates to air, water, and soil contamination; race, class, and privilege; expertise; ethics; and engaged citizenship.

The course is concerned with giving students the tools to prepare for the fields and jobs of the future.<br/>
Across all university departments and majors, the numbers of students who do not work in the fields in which they’ve received their degrees is not only significant, but growing. For example, anywhere from 20-40% of STEM graduates do not work in the fields in which they received their degrees.<br/>
This does not mean that students shouldn’t major in STEM, but</span><span class="deschide"> that one of the primary purposes of higher education is learning how to learn. Accordingly, this course presents a number of frameworks that are critical for thinking about that which has not yet been invented.<br/></span><br />

Why do many existing firms fail to incorporate new technology in a timely manner? At each stage of innovation, we examine key factors determining successful management of technology. What</span><span class="deschide"> constitutes a successful technology strategy? The integrating course focus will be on the emergence of the knowledge economy and technology as a key knowledge asset and will involve both general readings and cases.

This course is designed to examine the strategic issues that confront the management of the development stage biotech company, i.e., after its start-up via an initial capital infusion, but before it might be deemed successful (e.g., by virtue of a product launch), or otherwise has achieved &quot;first-tier&quot; status. Thus, the intention is to study the biotech organization during the process of it growth and maturation from an early stage existence</span><span class="deschide"> through &quot;adolescence&quot; into an &quot;adult&quot; company. The focus of the class will be on business development, i.e., the deal making that must occur to accomplish the corporate objectives of bringing in new technologies and getting the initial products to market. We will explore the critical deal issues from both the perspective of the development stage company and the viewpoint of the larger, more mature biotech or big pharma company with which it seeks to partner.</span><br />

Our general approach views technological innovation and competition</span><span class="deschide"> as dynamic processes that reflect previous choices made by firms and governments. Modern technologies develop in markets that are international scope, often imperfectly competitive, and subject to influence by a variety of economic and political stakeholders. We will use an eclectic mix of theoretical, historical, and practical perspectives throughout the course in examining these issues, although no special familarity with any of these is assumed. From time to time, we will be joined by venture capitalists, corporate executives, and technologists engaged in global high-technology markets for discussion of these issues.</span><br />

This course involves the flows of materials and information among all of the firms that contribute value to a product, from the source of raw materials to end customers. Elements of supply chain management have been studied and practiced for some time in marketing, logtistics, and operations management. We will attempt to integrate these different perspectives to develop a broad understanding of how to manage a supply change. This course will focus</span><span class="deschide"> on effective supply chain strategies for companies that operate globally with emphasis on how to plan and integrate supply chain components into a coordinated system. You will be exposed to concepts and models important in supply chain planning with emphasis on key trade offs and phenomena. The course will introduce and utilize key tactics such as risk pooling and inventory placement, integrated planning and collaboration, and information sharing. Lectures, Internet simulations, computer exercises, and case discussions introduce various models and methods for supply chain analysis and optimization.</span><br />
