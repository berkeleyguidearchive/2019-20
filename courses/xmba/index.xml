This course introduces the world of operational and strategic turnarounds of troubled and underperforming businesses.

The course is taught by cases, with the view that the best way to learn leadership</span><span class="deschide"> is by taking the perspective of business leaders facing crises that demand new direction.

This course aims to improve the quality of decisions people make. Students learn to be aware of, and to avoid, common inferential errors and systematic biases in decision making. There are many decision traps that we tend to repeatedly fall into. These traps relate to how we think about risk and probability, how we learn from experience, and how we make choices. Upon completion, students will have internalized the basic principles of decision making and will be</span><span class="deschide"> able to avoid falling into these traps. The course additionally aims to create a deeper understanding of the psychology of decision making, which can create an advantage in negotiations and other interactions through gaining an awareness of the predictable mistakes of others.</span><br />
