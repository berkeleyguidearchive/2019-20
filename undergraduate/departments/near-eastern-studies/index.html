<h2>Overview</h2>




<p>Instruction in the Department of Near Eastern Studies (NES) is concerned with the languages, literatures, and civilizations of the ancient, medieval, and modern Near and Middle East. The department offers specialized training in archaeology, art history, Assyriology, Egyptology, Iranian studies, Judaic studies, Islamic studies, comparative Semitics, and Turkish, Hebrew, Arabic, and Persian languages and literatures. Lecture courses offered by the department present a comprehensive body of information on past Near and modern Middle Eastern civilizations. For students in other disciplines, the department provides a wide variety of courses to supplement related fields including anthropology, linguistics, art history, history, political science, comparative literature, and folklore. Courses in the department are often small to medium-sized and afford students an opportunity for close interaction with the instructing staff.</p>




<p>The Department of Near Eastern Studies offers the following undergraduate majors:</p>




<ul>
	<li>The Major in Near Eastern Languages and Literatures (emphasis in a Modern Language: Arabic, Hebrew, or Persian; and emphasis in an Ancient Language: Egyptology)</li>
	<li>The Major in Ancient Egyptian and Near Eastern Art and Archaeology (emphasis in Ancient Near Eastern Art and Archaeology and emphasis in Egyptian Art and Archaeology)</li>
	<li>The Major in Near Eastern Civilizations (emphasis in Ancient Near Eastern Civilizations and emphasis in Islamic Civilizations)</li>
</ul>




<p>Minors are also available in Ancient Egyptian and Near Eastern Civilizations and in the modern languages taught in the department.</p>




<a name="libraries"></a>
<h3>Libraries</h3>




<p>The Near Eastern Studies libraries are essential parts of the Department of Near Eastern Studies. These non-circulating libraries are important for research for both graduate and undergraduate students in the department. <span>The libraries house reference materials relating to the various disciplines within NES, as well as more general monographs and serials, and serve as seminar classrooms. </span></p>




<p><span>The <strong>Hebrew/Semitics Library</strong> and the <strong>Islamic Studies Library</strong> both contain basic reference materials, including dictionaries and encyclopedias, and some of the most important texts in their fields. Access is generally limited to graduate students in the department. Both libraries are non-circulating. </span></p>




<p>The <strong>Baer-Keller Library of Egyptology</strong> is a non-circulating collection of approximately 9,000 volumes maintained by the Near Eastern Studies Department primarily for the use of UC Berkeley students and faculty pursuing serious study of Ancient Egyptian culture, Coptology, and Papyrology. Egyptology students and professionals from other institutions are also welcome. Interested individuals should apply to the Near Eastern Studies Department. <span>The core of the library collection comes from bequests to the Department of Near Eastern Studies by Professors Klaus Baer (1987) and Cathleen (Candy) Keller (2008). Professor Baer was an Associate Professor of Egyptology and History at UC Berkeley before becoming a Professor of Egyptology at the Oriental Institute, University of Chicago. Professor Keller was an Associate Professor of Egyptology at UC Berkeley for many years.</span></p>




<p>Cooperative arrangements between the University and the nearby Graduate Theological Union enable students in the department to use the extensive library holdings of the Union and supplement their programs with selected courses in Palestinian archaeology, Biblical studies, and Semitic epigraphy and philology.</p>

Ancient Egypt has fascinated visitors since antiquity to our modern imagination. From mummies, pyramids, and enchanting mythologies, these fanciful ideas have made their ways into books, movies, cartoons, and music. This course will explore the way ancient Egypt has been “consumed” in the West from the Napoleonic campaign to modern pop culture. We will study the impact that ancient Egypt and its wonderful monuments and civilization has had on art, literature,</span><span class="deschide"> music, and even a number of religious and spiritual movements in the West as well as in Middle Eastern and African cultures.</span><br/>

The course focuses on ancient astronomy from Babylonia to the Greco-Roman world. Readings from primary texts, including Babylonian astronomical and astrological documents (MUL.APIN, Enuma Anu Enlil, etc.) and Greek treatises such as Geminos= Introduction to the Phenomena and Ptolemy's Almagest are used. Problems of the calendar and of planetary motion are of special interest. Two different approaches to celestial phenomena are covered, one from</span><span class="deschide"> cuneiform texts, predominantly arithmetical and linear and the other from hellenistic Greek antiquity, characteristically geometrical and introducing a quantitative dimension only after contact with and borrowing from Babylonian astronomy.</span><br/>

The most famous of Babylonian heroes is Gilgamesh, King of Uruk. The Gilgamesh Epic, recorded on twelve tablets in cuneiform, follows him in his quest for fame and eternal life. In this course, we will read the Gilgamesh Epic as well as several earlier texts around the same character. Moreover, we will read additional ancient texts that elucidate one or another aspect of the Epic. We will follow the traditions around Gilgamesh and see how his fame</span><span class="deschide"> was used for literary, religious, and political purposes. Finally, we will look at some of the modern Gilgamesh interpretations.</span><br/>

Today, much of the information we gather on any topic comes from Internet sources. Goal of this class is to increase students' skills in critically evaluating the scholarly value of information on the Ancient Near East that is to be found in web pages, e-journals, and online books. We will consider the goal and context of sources of information (touristic, commercial, scholarly, religious, etc.) and how this influences and filters the information</span><span class="deschide"> provided. Although the class will focus on Internet resources, we will not neglect to use the same critical eye when using print media. The class will feature a number of collaborative projects in which this critical attitude may be practiced.</span><br/>

The course will outline art and archaeology of the Silk Roads from the 5th century BCE to the 10th century CE. A number of specific sites located along the Silk Roads will be selected and explored in depth, as examples which reveal the manifold cultural currents along the trade routes. Special attention will be paid to the eclecticism in Silk Road cultures brought about by the movement of peoples and merchandise which facilitated the spread</span><span class="deschide"> and fusion along these trading routes of various ideas, cultural forms, art styles, and religious concepts. The social and political underpinnings of this eclecticism will be examined.</span><br/>

This course examines the social and religious lives of women and men through the lens of the law. A major concern is the relationship between law and culture, namely, the ways in which the law reflected ideals and tensions ranging from ideological competition between states to the problems of ordinary townspeople and peasants. In analyzing actual court cases, we will ask how individuals participated in the life of the court, and how they used the court to articulate</span><span class="deschide"> their own self-interest and sense of moral worth. Readings will be in English. Students wishing to work with sources in the original Ottoman Turkish should also enroll in Turkish 104 (1 unit).</span><br/>
