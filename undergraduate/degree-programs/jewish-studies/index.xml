<h3>Minor</h3>
<p>The Jewish Studies minor is open to all UC Berkeley students and is designed to give students an overview of some of the major themes in Jewish Studies.   Students may choose offerings from a large number of disciplines including arts and humanities, social sciences, and law. After completing an introductory survey course, participants in the minor may take classes, seminars, and language courses (Hebrew in the Near Eastern Studies Department, and Yiddish in the German Department), engage in hands-on experiential learning through the Magnes Collection for Jewish Art and Life, and take relevant courses offered in various departments including Jewish Studies, Comparative Literature, History, Music, Near Eastern Studies, Political Science, and Sociology. The program allows students to work closely with members of the faculty, to be mentored by graduate students, and to participate in the intellectual life of the broader Jewish Studies community on campus.<a href="http://jewishstudies.berkeley.edu/courses-degree-programs/academic-degree-programs/#minor"> </a><a href="http://live-jewish-studies.pantheon.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/minor-infoapplication-packet_2019.pdf">Application instructions for the minor</a>.</p>

<p>Students who have a strong interest in an area of study outside their major often decide to complete a minor program. These programs have set requirements and are noted officially on the transcript in the memoranda section, as well as on diplomas.</p>
<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
	<li>All minors must be declared no later than one semester before a student's Expected Graduation Term (EGT). If the semester before EGT is fall or spring, the deadline is the last day of RRR week. If the semester before EGT is summer, the deadline is the final Friday of Summer Sessions. To declare a minor, contact the department advisor for information on requirements, and the declaration process.</li>
	<li>Five relevant upper division courses (including <span class="sc_courseinline">JEWISH 100</span> core course), minimum 3 units each, are required to complete the undergraduate minor.</li>
	<li>All courses taken to fulfill minor requirements below must be taken for graded credit.</li>
	<li>A minimum of three of the upper division courses taken to fulfill the minor requirements must be completed at UC Berkeley.</li>
	<li>A minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 is required for courses used to fulfill the minor requirements.</li>
	<li>Courses used to fulfill the minor requirements may be applied toward the Seven-Course Breadth requirement, for Letters &amp; Science students.</li>
	<li>No more than one upper division course may be used to simultaneously fulfill requirements for a student's major and minor programs.</li>
	<li>All minor requirements must be completed within the unit ceiling. (For further information regarding the unit ceiling, please see the College Requirements tab.)</li>
</ol>
<p>The study of Modern Hebrew, Biblical Hebrew, or Yiddish is encouraged and is essential for some but not all of the courses. However, there is no language requirement for the Jewish Studies minor and only advanced language courses are applicable to the minor.</p>

The course takes us far beyond contemporary tensions between Muslims and Jews, and deep into a more complicated history that spans the Mediterranean and beyond. We move through topics that include the earliest encounters between Muslims and Jews during the years of the rise of Islam; the historical impact and legacy of the dhimmi (the system of rights and restrictions that defined Jews’ status for centuries under Islamic rule); the culturally fruitful shared experience</span><span class="deschide"> of Jews and Muslims in Medieval Spain and the Ottoman Empire; the effects of French, British, and Italian colonialism in the modern Middle East; and the important conflicts over Zionism and Arab nationalism during the past century.</span><br/>
